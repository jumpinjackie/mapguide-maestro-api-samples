Manifest.addin

This is the addin manifest that SharpDevelop Core will look for in each addin directory. This contains important information about the
addin and how various aspects of the addin will integrate into the main Maestro application.

    Maestro Add-In anatomy
    
    Maestro exposes a whole series of extension points, these extension points are indicated by the <Path>
    element.
    
    When Maestro loads all the add-ins it can find, it creates a merged AddIn registry of all these extension
    points and their merged contents. Any class registered here can be instantiated by the AddIn registry.
    
    Classes that are registered must use the fully qualified name.
    
    Maestro offers the following extension points:
    
     /Maestro/ApplicationServices
        - Register application-level service classes
        
     /Maestro/Shell/MainMenu
        - Register commands to be merged into Maestro's main menu
        
     /Maestro/Shell/SingleViewContent
        - Register single-instance view classes
        
     /Maestro/Shell/Toolbars/Main
        - Register commands to be merged into Maestro's main toolbar
        
     /Maestro/Shell/SiteExplorer/Toolbar
        - Register commands to be merged into the Site Explorer's toolbar
        
     /Maestro/Shell/SiteExplorer/SelectedFolder
        - Register commands to be merged into the Site Explorer context menu for a selected folder. These are usually commands that operate on a single folder selected in the site explorer
        
     /Maestro/Shell/SiteExplorer/SelectedFolders
        - Register commands to be merged into the Site Explorer context menu for selected folders. These are usually commands that operate on multiple folders selected in the site explorer
        
     /Maestro/Shell/SiteExplorer/SelectedDocument
        - Register commands to be merged into the Site Explorer context menu for a selected document. These are usually commands that operate on a single document selected in the site explorer
        
     /Maestro/Shell/SiteExplorer/SelectedDocuments
        - Register commands to be merged into the Site Explorer context menu for selected documents. These are usually commands that operate on multiple documents selected in the site explorer
        
     /Maestro/Shell/SiteExplorer/SelectedMixedResources
        - Register commands to be merged into the Site Explorer context menu for multiple selected itmes. These are usually commands that operate on a multiple selected items in the site explorer
        
     /Workspace/Tools
        - Register commands to be registered under Maestro's "Tools" menu
        
     /Workspace/Autostart
        - Register commands to be executed on application startup (after add-ins have been loaded)
        
    Other add-ins may offer their own extension points, which you will have to consult their respective documentation
    
    WARNING: You must get the class names correct here. If you change them due to things like refactoring, you must update the matching names here, otherwise
    the SharpDevelop Core will raise a warning about this (which is a good thing in a sense)
