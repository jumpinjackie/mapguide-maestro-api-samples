After many milestones without a solid SDK story (due to various libraries now targeting .net standard and being delivered as nuget packages), a new SDK story has been defined.

We now provide a github repo that contains most of the existing SDK contents at: https://github.com/jumpinjackie/mapguide-maestro-sdk

This repo contains:
 - Existing SDK code samples
 - The existing "legacy" webforms demo
 - A new MVC core demo using the Maestro API
 - The source for the Local Native Connection Provider with 2 project variants:
   - One referencing MapGuide .net assemblies of your local MapGuide installation
   - One referencing the MapGuide .net API nuget packages

MASSIVE BREAKING CHANGES. High level overview:
 - Resource object classes and various interfaces moved to separate OSGeo.MapGuide.ObjectModels assembly
 - OSGeo.MapGuide.ExtendedObjectModels is gone. No need to call ModelSetup.Initialize() anymore
 - OSGeo.MapGuide.ObjectModels.* assemblies have been merged into OSGeo.MapGuide.ObjectModels
 - ObjectFactory has been moved to OSGeo.MapGuide.ObjectModels and is the one-stop shop for object creation and XML serialization to/from resource classes
 - ResourceTypeRegistry is no longer public and relevant APIs exposed in ObjectFactory
 - IResource now resides in OSGeo.MapGuide.ObjectModels and no longer has an attached IServerConnection property. Any helper
   extension methods that previously relied on this fact now take an IServerConnection parameter to provide context.
 - Applications will now generally need to reference OSGeo.MapGuide.ObjectModels in addition to OSGeo.MapGuide.MaestroAPI for most existing code to compile
   and work as before.
 - Need to target .net Framework 4.5 as a minimum (6.0m5 onwards)

- New utility included: SignMapGuideApi.exe 
    - Use this tool to sign official MapGuide/AIMS .net assemblies with the maestroapi.key
    
- Includes source for the Maestro.LocalNative connection provider, allowing you to compile your own connection provider against your specific version of MapGuide/AIMS
    - Assembly binding redirection is no longer supported
    - Pre-built binaries for MGOS 2.2 included

- Updated samples to match current APIs

3.5

- New Desktop Samples
    - StandaloneWebLayoutEditor

- General Notes:
    - The Topology.dll reference has been replaced with NetTopologySuite.Merged.dll. If you reference this assembly, you
      will need to update some namespace imports (anything under the Topology namespace will have to be changed). Visual Studio
      can assist with updating namespace references.
